    \brief OSGTime
 
    Time supplies two time measurement methods.
    
    The first is the system time (getSystemTime()). It is measured in
    seconds and started at an unspecified start point, so it's only
    useful for relative measurements. It has limited resolution (~20 ms on
    Windows, better on Linux), but will not wrap around in a reasonable
    timeframe.

    The second is the time stamp (getTimeStamp()). It is measured in an
    unspecified integer unit, but the number of time stamp ticks per second
    can be inquired via getTimeStampFreq(), or a number of TimeStamp ticks
    can be converted to milliseconds using getTimeStampMsecs(). It has at
    least the same resolution as the system time, but can be much higher. 
    Currently it is only higher on Intel/AMD CPUs. It can be used to measure
    very short time periods, but should not be used for long measurements.
