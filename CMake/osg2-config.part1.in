# Commandline tool for querying information about OpenSG libraries and required
# flags to compile.
#
# Much of this file is autogenerated at build time, so make sure to modify
# the .in version of this file in the build if you want to make changes
#
# The main components of this file are:
# - A set of classes at the end of the file that are automatically included
#   from the OpenSG build system.  These are used to store and analyze
#   the library information.  Most of the logic used in this tool is in these classes.
# - A string rep list of dictionaries that are automatically created by the build
#   and represent the state of the library objects from the build.  This list
#   is used to construct a local representation of the library information for OpenSG.
# - The option parser.  This section of the code is responsible for reading options and
#   calling the appropriate methods of the library info classes.
